# For any number K, the sum of 2 values (A & B) is evenly divisible by K if the sum of the remainders of A/K + B/K is K. Special case when a and b are divisible,
# giving a sum of 0. For any such remainder, there is 1 and only 1 other remainder value which will make a sum divisible by K.

# Maybe create a list of the pairs to sum in order to get k.
