Today, cyber security problems and attacks are usually solved by experts and professionals in the field, manually.
Cyber security's focus is to identify every instance of malicious behaviour and to not leave things to probability. Identification of each event is crucial.

The problem with this approach?
- Takes time to analyze a large number of events/logs.
- Requires experts.
- Manual process and requires thorough investigation.
- Even with a thorough investigation it is possible that some events may be missed.

Identifying anomalies is really hard, because they have never been seen before.

How do you solve this problem?
- Create a malicious behaviour context based on domain knowledge.
- Use this context to identify and classify anomalies as such.
- See if the model fits your contextual assumptions.

Anomalous behaviour detection in cyber security is unsupervised.

How it all works?
1. We still have experts who can identify if these identified behaviours are indeed malicious.
2. The info we provide speeds up the analytics and investigation.
3. The building of context and classifing unexpected behaviour removes the need to go through unnecessary data.
4. We use this feedback at multiple levels:
    - improve features that go into the context,
    - modifying context itself
    - look at changes in thresholds
    - use the feedback as a mechanism to turn the problem into a supervised one

Event correlation and behavioural identification.

Individual logs and log correlation is really important. Logs should not be left alone in vacuum. Consecutive events and events correlated by time should be considered.

1. Defining the right context to identify anomalous malicious events.
2. Identification of correlated events for logs.
3. Transformation of anomalous behaviour.
4. Verifying with experts.

Using AI to constantly adapt to new advances and threats, instead of being programmed to deal with already known threats.
Old defense mechanisms are unable to scale to the size of today's businesses. Think of AI as a helper tool for the cyber security expert. Like a K9 to a police officer.
